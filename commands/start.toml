description = "Prepares the model to start working on Dart code, based on the observation that conversation history is more powerful in getting the LLM to comply with the rules."

prompt = """
We're going to work on some Dart code, so please review the following for me:

1) Summarize the rules you have around working with Dart code.
2) Summarize the rules you have around working with Flutter code (on top of the Dart rules above)
3) Summarize the rules you have around working with Dartdoc API comments.
4) List the tools you have available for working with Dart code.

Please follow these rules closely for this session, and prefer using the tools over just running `dart` or `flutter` on the command line.
