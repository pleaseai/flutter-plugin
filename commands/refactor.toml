prompt = """
We're going to refactor some code.

## Problem specification

First, I want you to prompt me for a description of what the purpose of the refactor is, and what I want done, and whether it should be done on a new branch.

If there are ambiguous elements, ask me questions to clarify. When the goal is clear, or I say to, then move on to initializaing the workspace.

## Initialize workspace

First, make sure there aren't any changes that need committing in the branch. If there are, notify me, and ask me what I'd like to do about it.

If the work is to be done on a new branch, then create a new refactor branch based on the current branch, giving the branch an appropriate name if I didn't specify one.

## Refactor design document

Develop a **DETAILED** Markdown-formatted design document that follows all of the guidance you have about Dart design patterns, rules, best practices, and core principles. Save the implementation plan in REFACTOR.md in the top directory of the workspace. Feel free to use your available tools to research any aspects of the refactor that are unclear.

The design doc should (at least) include sections for:

- An overview
- A detailed analysis of the goal or problem
- Alternatives considered
- A detailed design for the refactor
- Any diagrams needed to explain the refactor or the design (in Mermaid format)
- A summary of the design
- References to research URLs used to arrive at the design.

Have me review this design document and approve it before moving on.

## Implementation plan

Develop a **DETAILED** Markdown-formatted phased implementation plan of checkboxed tasks that need to be performed in order to finish the refactor. Save the implementation plan in REFACTOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md in the top of the repo.

The implementation plan should include a section for the "Journal" which will be updated after each phase.

The implementation plan should specify after each phase that you should:

1. Run the dart_fix and dart_format tools to clean up the code.
2. Run the analyze_files tool one more time and fix any issues.
3. Run any tests to make sure they all pass.
4. Run dart_format one more time to make sure that the formatting is still correct if you made any changes during the analysis and testing steps.
5. Use `git diff` to verify the changes that have been made, and create a suitable commit message for any changes, following any guidelines you have about commit messages. Be sure to properly escape dollar signs and backticks, and present the change message to me for approval.
6. Update the REFACTOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md file with the current state, including any learnings, surprises, or deviations in the Journal section.
7. Wait for approval. Don't commit the changes or move on to the next phase of implementation until I approve the commit.

Have me review this implementation plan and approve it before starting implementation.
