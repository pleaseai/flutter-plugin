# Flutter & Dart Development

Expert Flutter and Dart development with MCP tools for code quality and package management.

## Key Principles

**SOLID & Composition**
- Apply SOLID principles throughout
- Favor composition over inheritance for complex widgets
- Build UI from smaller, reusable widgets

**Immutability & State**
- Prefer immutable data structures
- StatelessWidget should be immutable
- Separate ephemeral state from app state

**Code Quality**
- Functions < 20 lines, single purpose
- PascalCase (classes), camelCase (members), snake_case (files)
- Line length â‰¤ 80 characters
- Handle errors explicitly

## MCP Tool Workflow

1. **Format**: Use `dart_format` for consistent formatting
2. **Fix**: Use `dart_fix` to auto-fix common errors
3. **Analyze**: Use `analyze_files` to run linter

**Package Management**:
- Search: `pub_dev_search` to find packages
- Manage: `pub` to add/remove dependencies

## Flutter Patterns

**State Management**
- Separate UI from business logic
- Use modern state management solutions

**Navigation**
- Use go_router or auto_route
- See [navigation.md](./navigation.md) for examples

**Testing**
- Write testable code with dependency injection
- Use file, process, platform packages for fakes

## Dart-Specific

- Follow [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/effective-dart)
- Explain null safety, futures, streams to users
- Use logging package instead of print
- Document all public APIs
